## Re write of the Alacritty Event Loop

While getting started on this I found an awesome project named [session-manager](https://github.com/nw0/session-manager).

This provided a great way for me to see how the lower level TTY code and ansi processing was implemented.

I played around with this for a while, adding support for colors and then upon realizing that most of this session-manager code came from Alacritty, decided that I should give adding tabs to Alacritty a shot.

When digging into the Alacritty source I realized I would need some struct to manage the tabs and Term/PTY struct state throughout the app. Unfortunately this meant passing around an Arc<Mutex<T>> and lots of locking and unlocking.

Luckily this mutex use along with the removal of the use of channels actually lead to performance improvements. I believe this may mostly be due to the simplified process of reading input from the TTY file descriptor. I now just spin off a thread for each tty and in that thread there is a simple loop which reads and then writes directly to the ansi processor, skipping the previous process of sending bytes over a channel and then into an event loop.

Currently the key bindings default to Command + T for a new tab. Command + Shift + Left Bracket for previous tab and Command + Shift + Right Bracket for the next tab.

The latest build of Alacritty with tabs can be found at [the release page](https://github.com/bebrws/alacritty-tabs/releases/).

The code is up at [alacritty-tabs](https://github.com/bebrws/alacritty-tabs/). Note that this has only been tested on OSX.

## New functionality

Ability to jump back up to the last time the return key was pressed

Defaults to Command + G
