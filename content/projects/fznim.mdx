## Introducing FZNim

I love fzf

It has become, by far, the most useful "new" command line tool I have. It can be a godsend when it comes to searching through.. anything. A good example is files and directories.

I always setup a folder named "repos" on my laptop where I store all my code repositories. Because of this I am constantly cd ing into this folder then cd ing into a specific repo folder to start work on a project.

Sometimes I cant rememeber the exact name of a repo or am just feeling lazy and now can save time and mental energy with a quick:

```

function cdr() {
	cd ~/repos/$(ls ~/repos | fzf)
}

cdr
```

With this command I can roughly type the repo I am looking for and jump into my project from anywhere on my laptop. I like this tool so much I thought there would be some use cases that weren't easy to script with fzf.

Maybe you have some more complicated input and output requirements than what can be done with a bash or zsh array of string.

Here is my [Nim clone of fzf, named FZNim](https://github.com/bebrws/fznim) (which can be used as a Nim and therefore C and Objective-C library):

I am working on some more useful fzf like ideas right now an hopefully will have something to show for it soon.

## FZNim code

### Interesting Issues

I ran into a few interesting issues. Like problems [getting keyboard input after piping in input into STDIN](/post/GettingSTDINAfterPipe) or needing to write [my own fuzzy string search in nim](/post/nimFuzzySearch).

### Terminal Colors

Coloring the terminal output actually ended up being pretty easy.

To get the escape code right I needed to use: "\e[1;" instead of "\033[0;"

To print out a string hello in blue in nim you could use:

```
echo "\e[1;34mhello\e[00m"
```

### NCurses or not

I thought about using ncurses here but saw there is a nice terminal import in the Nim standard library

With this I could set cursor position (setCursorPos) and clear the screen (eraseScreen). This was really all I needed.
