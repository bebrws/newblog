## Why?

I am trying to learn more about Rust and how Alacritty is so fast. This is also an attempt to explore the many different Rust graphics libraries.

This post is about [gfx](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx).

With gfx I managed to get the FPS I was looking for for this Game Of Life implementation.

[My code is here](https://github.com/bebrws/gol-gfx)

## How does it look?
