# Everyone hates paywalls

While opening up dev tools in any browser and removing a paywall div is easy, I ever knew that there was an easy way to actually view the rest of the content on the page.

The trick is that you find the content in the DOM you are looking for. This can be done in a number of ways. In the video I resized the page and the content comes into view. Then I see there are multiple divs below with more content. Normally I woulnd't know how to easily view this content. However Chrome has a nice feature where if you right click on a div and click "scroll into view" it will scroll down to that div.

So the first step is to delete the paywall div, then the second step is to find the divs with the text your interested in. Then you right click on that div and click scroll into view.
