# Everyone hates paywalls

So I knew how to get around paywalls, or how to remove them with my frontend developer experience. But I didn't know how to scroll down on the page until today.

I was just clicking around and found that if you right click on a div and click "scroll into view" it will scroll down to that div.

So the first step is to delete the paywall div, then the second step is to find the divs with the text your interested in. Then you right click on that div and click scroll into view.
