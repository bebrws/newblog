# leetcode-faangFAANG Interviews and LeetCode

## A Past Experience

I think I have always been embarrassed by an interview I had with Google when I was fresh out of college. I choked on a simpler problem (now that I look back on it).

Exhausted from the 8-hour final interview day, in the last round, I was asked to solve a problem involving determining the coordinates of an array of heights that would hold the maximum amount of water, if I remember correctly. I just choked, and once I believed I wouldn’t be able to find a solution, panic set in, and it became a reality.

Lesson learned there: Keep calm. Think. Talk. Do whatever you can to try and move forward. Who knows, maybe I would have even gotten some help if I hadn’t just frozen up.

Ironically, recently my parent company was acquired, and I received a message from Meta for an interview, so I decided to give it all a second shot. Thus began the long, arduous, multi-month process of interviews and coding challenges.

I was told to study LeetCode—medium to hard problems.

Since then, I’ve been doing so, and unfortunately, since it has been years since college, where I would have learned helpful algorithms, and I have rarely come across anything at work that is useful for these LeetCode problems, I have been relying on my memory and data structure knowledge to do my best to work through problems

## Leetcode is Challenging

These problems honestly make me feel like I have no chance with this interview process. I have heard that in the first interview, I can expect to solve two medium-level problems, each in 15 minutes.

Sure, I could do this with an O(N^2) solution, but I know that isn’t what they are looking for, and it honestly seems like half the problems have specific solutions relevant only to that problem.

HOWEVER, I have found myself building a repertoire of algorithms and possibly patterns that can be reused for specific problems or subsets of problems.

I was especially afraid of graphs, but actually, I solved one of these the easiest, with a decent solution compared to others, and [posted it here](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/solutions/5637250/simple-efficient-javascript-recursive-search-using-an-array-and-set-solution/).

## LeetCode Is Actually Pretty Fun and Rewarding

When you do find that you have the right algorithm or pattern in your pocket and can identify where to use it, it’s a great feeling.

While I am sure I won’t be implementing a quickSelect algorithm (when I can use a pre-existing data structure such as a priority queue, for example) in my day-to-day work, it has been a great learning experience and a great way to keep myself challenged and learning.

Even though I will probably perform poorly in the interview, as I didn’t give myself much, if any, time to prepare, I am glad I finally added a new way of learning and staying sharp.

Instead of my usual approaches of finding projects to create, tooling to make, or applications to reverse engineer, I can say that giving LeetCode a try was a great choice.
