## My Joystick Mouse With Zoom and Scroll

Just a little side project I thought was pretty cool. It actually works really well and is easy to get going *wired*. 

Creating a wireless mouse is actually much more work than I expected and I am focusing elsewhere currently but thought this mouse was pretty interesting and fun.

It is actually really usable and I really like the zoom toggle and scroll button that I have added.
