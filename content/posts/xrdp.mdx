# The Issues and Solutions

I was getting no and then garbled output when trying to connect to xrdp on Ubuntu.

To fix the no output and garbled lines you need to edit a file named **_/etc/X11/Xwrapper.config_** and add the following:

```
allowed_users =anybody
needs_root_rights=no
```

Then my **_/etc/xrdp/startwm.sh_** file looks like:

```
#!/bin/sh
# xrdp X session start script (c) 2015, 2017 mirabilos
# published under The MirOS Licence

unset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
unset XDG_RUNTIME_DIR

if [ -r /etc/default/locale ]; then
  . /etc/default/locale
  export LANG LANGUAGE
fi

gnome-session
exit 0
```

# The Remaining Issue

However after setting needs*root_rights=no in \*\*\_Xwrapper.config*\*\* I can no longer login from the actual PI Gnome login. This had to be removed and the Pi restarted to get logins working again.

# XFCE4 To th Rescue

Run:

```
sudo apt-get install -y xfce4
```

Edit **_/etc/xrdpstartwm.sh_**:

```
#!/bin/sh
# xrdp X session start script (c) 2015, 2017 mirabilos
# published under The MirOS Licence

unset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
unset XDG_RUNTIME_DIR

if [ -r /etc/default/locale ]; then
  . /etc/default/locale
  export LANG LANGUAGE
fi

# xfce
exec startxfce4
```
