# Rust Practice with Bevy

Bevy has an amazing dependency injection system that makes its "ECS" (Entity Component System) architecture very easy and ituitive to use.
Really the DI system is one of the most amazing Rust feats that I have seen so far.

Someone has taken the time to document how to create your own [Bevy based DI system here which is a great read](https://promethia-27.github.io/dependency_injection_like_bevy_from_scratch/chapter1/system.html)

There is also an unofficial Bevy book that is really helpful [here](https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/programming/intro-data.html)

# My Snake Clone

# And Compiled to WASM and Played Here!
