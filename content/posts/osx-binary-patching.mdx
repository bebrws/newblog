## Getting a patched binary to run on OSX

Say you are reverse engineering some application on OSX and have modified the
binary in a hex editor. You can't just run the binary because OSX has a
number of security features.

First off I have gatekeeper disabled on my machine. You can do this by running:

```
sudo spctl --master-disable
```

Although I do not believe this is necessary if you codesign the binary after patching.

So after patching the binary I codesign the binary with an ID I get from the following list:

```
security find-identity -v -p codesigning
```

Then take the ID from the above command and run the following command:

```
sudo codesign --force --sign {ID FROM ABOVE} patched-binary
```

Then I had to unquarantine the binary by running:

```
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine patched-binary
```

Then I was able to run the binary.
